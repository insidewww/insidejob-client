The problem: adding exhibition views is breakneck
Solution: Combine all media in dynamic array

- each media optionaly should have data e.g. description (by default: Title, medium, year || media.description)
    problem: media data will not update until array will be saved again
        solution: store only media id's (unique field) in the array and generate media get response on backend dynamically.
            - description will be taken depending on media relation (if it's relateed to some work else 'Exhibition view') 


Dashboard: get all the media (project + works), then create new array of selectedMedia and send to backend

Server: Generate media array from received id's array. For each media get it's description. Store it in media.description if it's empty.

Client: display the array of full refs.
